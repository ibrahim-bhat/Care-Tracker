### 1. **Live Queue Tracking**
**What to do:**
- **Fetch and Display Queue Data:** You'll need to get the patient's current queue position and estimated wait time. This could come from an API, or for simulation, you can use `localStorage` or mock data. In a real scenario, this data would come from a backend, but here, you'll use JavaScript to simulate this.
  
- **Update Queue Info:** You will want the queue information to update automatically, so every few seconds, you’ll refresh the data. Use a method like `setInterval` or `setTimeout` to repeatedly fetch the queue status and update the UI.
  
- **UI Updates:** Once you fetch the queue data, update the webpage dynamically. This means using JavaScript to change the text or other elements on the page (like updating a number or changing a progress bar).

### 2. **Distance-Based Notifications**
**What to do:**
- **Geolocation API:** Use the `navigator.geolocation` API to access the user’s current location. This is built into most browsers, so you can easily retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates.
  
- **Distance Calculation:** Once you have the patient’s location, calculate the distance between the patient and the hospital. This can be done using basic math (like the Haversine formula), or you can use a library like `geolib` to simplify the calculation.
  
- **Trigger Alerts:** When the calculated distance is within a certain range (e.g., 5 km or less), show a notification or alert prompting the patient to leave for their appointment. This could be a pop-up or a message on the screen.

### 3. **Real-Time Progress Tracker**
**What to do:**
- **Display Queue Progress:** Create a visual progress bar or indicator that shows how many people are ahead of the patient in the queue and how long they might have to wait. The progress bar should move smoothly as time goes on.
  
- **Smooth Updates:** You’ll need to ensure that as the queue progresses, the visual elements (like the progress bar) update dynamically, without reloading the page. This can be done by using `setInterval` to periodically update the UI based on changing data.
  
- **Visual Effects:** To make the updates feel smoother, use CSS animations or transitions for the progress bar. This makes the updates feel less abrupt and more visually engaging.

### 4. **Doctor Availability**
**What to do:**
- **Simulate Doctor Schedules:** For each doctor, you'll have a schedule that shows available time slots. Use mock data or `localStorage` to simulate these schedules. You can have time slots displayed as a list or calendar.
  
- **Display Doctor’s Time Slots:** Dynamically show each doctor’s available time slots. You can represent this as a list of times or use a calendar-style view where patients can see when slots are open.
  
- **Update Doctor Availability:** If a doctor’s availability changes (e.g., they are booked or delayed), you’ll want to automatically update the UI to reflect this change. You can achieve this by periodically checking the status and updating the schedule.

### 5. **Emergency Alerts**
**What to do:**
- **Highlight Emergency Cases:** Whenever an emergency case comes up, highlight it on the screen so it stands out from the rest of the queue. This could be achieved by changing the background color or adding an icon or notification.
  
- **Real-Time Priority Updates:** Use JavaScript to dynamically update the status of emergency cases as they are attended to. You can update UI elements like priority rankings or patient statuses in real-time.
  
- **Alert Notifications:** You’ll want to trigger an alert (either a notification or an on-screen pop-up) when an emergency case is recognized or when the status changes. This ensures that the emergency is highlighted immediately.

### 6. **E-Prescription Integration**
**What to do:**
- **Upload E-Prescriptions:** Let doctors upload prescriptions as files (e.g., PDFs or images). JavaScript can be used to handle file uploads, check the file type, and provide a preview before the upload is completed.
  
- **Display Prescriptions:** Once the prescription is uploaded, display it on the page. This could be as an embedded PDF viewer or an image viewer, depending on the file type.
  
- **Interactive Prescriptions Viewer:** For better user experience, you might want to provide an interactive viewer, allowing the user to zoom in on the prescription or download it. JavaScript can help embed such functionality.

### 7. **Medical History Tracker**
**What to do:**
- **Display Medical History:** Use JavaScript to dynamically generate and display a list of the patient’s previous medical records and appointments. This data could come from an API or be simulated using mock data.
  
- **Search and Filter:** Implement a search or filter feature so that patients can find specific records based on criteria like date, doctor, or medical condition. JavaScript can be used to filter the list without needing to reload the page.
  
- **Interactive Data View:** Allow users to scroll through the medical records, or implement pagination for easier navigation through long lists. JavaScript will handle the logic for showing a certain number of records at a time and managing pagination.

### 8. **Integrated Payment Gateway (Frontend)**
**What to do:**
- **Simulate Payment Forms:** Create a form where users can enter payment details (e.g., credit card info). For simulation, you can use mock data and simulate the payment process.
  
- **Validate Payment Form:** Before submitting the payment form, you’ll need to check that the user has entered all the necessary details, like card number, expiration date, etc. JavaScript is used for form validation to make sure all fields are correctly filled out.
  
- **Display Payment Confirmation:** Once the payment is processed (or simulated), show a confirmation message on the screen. This can be a simple success or failure message that lets the patient know whether their payment was successful or not.

### 9. **Feedback System**
**What to do:**
- **Submit Feedback:** Allow patients to submit feedback using a form. The feedback could be in the form of a rating (e.g., stars) or a text review. JavaScript will capture the form data and submit it.
  
- **Validate Feedback Form:** Before submission, validate that all fields in the feedback form are properly filled out. JavaScript can ensure that the user doesn’t submit an empty review or leave required fields blank.
  
- **Show Confirmation:** Once feedback is successfully submitted, show a confirmation message. This could be a simple “Thank you for your feedback!” message or an animation to confirm the submission.
  
- **Display Feedback:** Dynamically display the latest feedback submissions on the page. You could show them in a list or as cards. JavaScript will be used to update the page in real-time as new feedback comes in.
  
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Optionally, you could use `setInterval` to fetch and display new feedback submissions automatically without requiring the user to refresh the page.

### Summary:
Each of these tasks involves dynamically updating the webpage, handling user interactions, and providing real-time feedback using JavaScript. The key JavaScript concepts you'll need to focus on include:
- **Event Handling:** Listening for user actions like clicks, form submissions, and geolocation data.
- **AJAX / Fetch API:** Communicating with the backend for real-time data updates.
- **LocalStorage / SessionStorage:** Storing temporary data locally.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically changing elements on the page based on real-time data.
- **Timers (setInterval / setTimeout):** Updating the UI at regular intervals for live data.
- **Validation:** Ensuring that the data entered by the user is correct and complete.
